# Figma to Code: HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS  

This project transforms a design from [Figma](https://figma.com) into functional code using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to convert the user interface design into a fully responsive and styled website.  

## Technologies Used  

- **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the content.  
- **CSS3**: For custom styles (when needed).  
- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS framework for rapid and scalable development.  
- **Figma**: Source of the initial design.
